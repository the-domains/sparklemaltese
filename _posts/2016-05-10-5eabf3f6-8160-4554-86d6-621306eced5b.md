description: "Recently I spoke with Aaron Oâ€™Neal, Top Dog Chef for Sparkle Maltese, and we started chatting about the need for fresh cooking for their pups and the parent pooches. I was amazed at the wealth of recipes that he has for the two superstar parents, Jaeger and Cognac, alone. Carla and Aaron are setting themselves apart in this business by giving the new pups and parents the best possible care they can receive. Not only in veterinary care, but in the quality of food that your new pup recieves once on solid foods. Be on the lookout for Aarons' blog and video cooking tutorials that will add a much needed spark to you puppies life."
